*The best-laid plans of mice and men...*

My group's research in computational neuroscience is broadly concerned with how brains control behaviour. In many settings, behaviour involves sequences of actions that need careful planning. In this talk, I will present our recent work on planning in recurrent neural networks (Jensen et al., Nat. Neurosci, 2024). I will show that decision-making networks trained with the ability to decide for themselves (i) when to pause and ‘think’, and (ii) what to do with those ‘thoughts’, recapitulate key aspects of human planning in a flexible navigation task. We show that this network-level theory of planning is supported by neural recordings from the hippocampus of rodents. I will strive to make this accessible for the whole of DivF, and to wrap up in 25 min, but then again, the best-laid plans of mice and men...
